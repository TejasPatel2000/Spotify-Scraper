Project 1
a. What are at least 3 technical issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?
    1. While working on deploying my code with Flask, I ran into multiple errors. The first being that once I created my app on Heroku, I was having trouble actually deploying my code on the app. After more research I was able to find
    this link, https://stackabuse.com/deploying-a-flask-application-to-heroku/. Where it gave more flask related steps to deploying, so from there I was able to successfully deploy my app.
    The next issue I ran into this was with deploying any changes I made. Using "git push heroku master" was not working and was throwing various errors. After more research, I found a command on stackOverflow "git push heroku HEAD:master"
    that resolved this issue for me.
    2. Ran into issue authorizing spotipy while deploying to heroku.
b. What are known problems, if any, with your project? 
c. What would you do to improve your project in the future?
